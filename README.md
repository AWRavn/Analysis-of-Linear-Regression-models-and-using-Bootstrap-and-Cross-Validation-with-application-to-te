Project work for FYS-STK4155: Applied Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Project 1
The aim of this project is to perform the analysis of the Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression Models using Bootstrap and Cross-Validation.

See the report for detailed explanation of the scope of this project.

## Project 2
The aim of this project was to compare common Regression Meodels with the MLP Feed Forward Neural Network when applied to a Regression problem, as well as to compare Logistic Regression Model with the MLP Feed Forward Neural Network when applied to a Classification problem. 

See the report for detailed explanation of the scope of this project.
